# Layouts and Partials

* Layouts can be seen as the container for a view.  Each view is rendered within a layout.  We can use layouts for common header/footer material.
* Partials are used to DRY views.  We can use them to move code that is repeated in several views into a separate _partial_ file.
* Views are rendered into the `<%= yield %>` tag in the layout.

When the app is created, Rails will automatically add a layout `application.html.erb` in `app/views/layouts/application.html.erb`. This layout already contains a yield statement and all the links to css and js files in the head part of the html document.

## Using views with Rails

In Rails, the basic logic for rendering a view is quite straightforward.  Given that every route in Rails will execute a method inside a controller, when the method is executed, Rails will look for:

1. A folder inside `views` corresponding to the controller's name (folder `posts` for `PostsController`).
2. A file with the method's name and `.html.erb`.

For example , if we call `http://localhost:3000/posts`, Rails will execute the method `index` in the controller `posts` and then look for a template located in `app/views/posts/index.html.erb`.  By default controller methods will render views files that match the controller method name.

In some cases though, you may want to render a template with a different name than the current method. Lets take a look at this action:

```ruby
def create
  @post = Post.new(post_params)

  respond_to do |format|
    if @post.save
      format.html { redirect_to @post, notice: 'Post was successfully created.' }
      format.json { render :show, status: :created, location: @post }
    else
      format.html { render :new }
      format.json { render json: @post.errors, status: :unprocessable_entity }
    end
  end
end
```

Based on the result of `@post.save`, the method will execute either the code in the `if` or in the `else`.  The code `format.html` or `format.json` means that Rails will understand the format asked for by the user, whether HTML or JSON.  For the moment, we will only look at the lines starting with `format.html`.

You can see that depending upon whether `@post` correctly saves, the `new` page will be rendered or the response will be a redirect.  Neither one of these renders a `create.html.erb` file.

Rails will, _by default_, render the template that has the same name as the current controller method. But, **if** there is a `render` statement in the method, Rails will use whatever view is specified by that method.

Let's take a look at a few different ways of calling render:


```ruby
render :edit
render "edit"
render action: :edit
render "edit.html.erb"
render "books/edit"
render "books/edit.html.erb"
render template: "books/edit"
render template: "books/edit.html.erb"
render "/path/to/rails/app/views/books/edit"
render "/path/to/rails/app/views/books/edit.html.erb"
render file: "/path/to/rails/app/views/books/edit"
render file: "/path/to/rails/app/views/books/edit.html.erb"
```

# Layouts

Layouts wrap views.  They are typically used for content that you want to appear on many/all pages on a site.  For example, every page needs the css and javascript files to be included, so we put that in the layout.  Similarly if you're using bootstrap you may have a `<div class='container'>` that you put all the content into.  We can put that `div` into the layout as well.  

* This helps keep our views DRY - we don't repeat common content in each file.


# Partials

A best practice is to always keep every template as small as possible. A rule of thumb would be to keep templates shorter than about 50 lines.  This helps to improve readability.  We can use partials to do this as they allow us to take portions of the template and move them into separate files.  This is particularly useful when you have content that is repeated on more than one page associated with a controller.

* Partials are always named starting with an underscore: `_form.html.erb`
* Partials can be called directly from inside a view file.  `<%= render "menu" %>`
  * You don't specify the `_` when calling the partial.
* You can pass data to a partial: `<%= render partial: "customer", object: @new_customer %>`

### Calling partials

Render a partial in the current views directory named `_product.html.erb`
```erb
<%= render "product" %>
```

We can store our partials in a shared folder. We will create a folder at the `view` level called `shared`. Render a partial in `shared/_footer.html.erb`
```erb
<%= render "shared/footer" %>
```

Pass a variable `product` to a partial to be used within the partial:

```erb
<% @products.each do |product| %>
  <%= render partial: "product", locals: {product: product} %>
<% end %>
```

Rails will automatically choose a partial that matches the model name if you pass it an instance of a model.  In the following it will look for an `_product.html.erb` file to render.

```erb
<%= render @product %>
```

Partials can make use of a layout:
```erb
<%= render partial: "link_area", layout: "graybar" %>
```

When a partial is called with a `:collection`, the individual instances of the partial have access to the member of the collection being rendered via a variable named after the partial. In this case, the partial is _product, and within it you can refer to product to get the collection member that is being rendered.

```erb
<%= render partial: "product", collection: @products %>
```

### Using partials and layouts

Within a layout the view is inserted at the `<%= yield %>`

If your website is structured like:

```
  -----    header with menu      -----
  -----    current page content  -----
  -----    current page content  -----
  -----    current page content  -----
  -----    footer                -----
```

Then we should probably move the top menu and the footer into the layout.  This leaves us with templates that look like:

```
-----    current page content  -----
-----    current page content  -----
-----    current page content  -----
```

and a layout that looks like:

```
  -----    header with menu      -----
  -----    <%= yield %>          -----
  -----    footer                -----
```
That `yield` is where the current page content will be rendered.

Another alternative would be to move the _header with menu_ into a partial instead.  This option would be best when for example we only use the menu on some pages, but not all.

**DRY views**: Likewise if we have a couple of views that are using the same form code or have the same submenu or other HTML code we should consider moving that code into a partial.  Example:

```
# new.html.erb
-----  new instructions text  -----
-----  form                   -----
-----  form-inputs            -----
-----  form-submit            -----
-----  other info             -----

# edit.html.erb
-----  edit instructions text -----
-----  form                   -----
-----  form-inputs            -----
-----  form-submit            -----
```

In the above case it would be very common to take the `form` out of both pages and put it inside a partial.  Result:

```
# new.html.erb
-----  new instructions text  -----
-----  render :form           -----
-----  other info             -----

# edit.html.erb
-----  edit instructions text -----
-----  render :form           -----

# _form.html.erb
-----  form                   -----
-----  form-inputs            -----
-----  form-submit            -----
```

Much DRYer!




# URL helpers

Before we look at some View helpers let's take a minute to talk about the URL helpers in Rails.

Rails adds helpers that express the URL for routes in your app.  These are configured through the router.

Let's look at some `rake routes` output:

```
$ rake routes
     Prefix Verb   URI Pattern                 Controller#Action
    turkeys GET    /turkeys(.:format)          turkeys#index
            POST   /turkeys(.:format)          turkeys#create
 new_turkey GET    /turkeys/new(.:format)      turkeys#new
edit_turkey GET    /turkeys/:id/edit(.:format) turkeys#edit
     turkey GET    /turkeys/:id(.:format)      turkeys#show
            PATCH  /turkeys/:id(.:format)      turkeys#update
            PUT    /turkeys/:id(.:format)      turkeys#update
            DELETE /turkeys/:id(.:format)      turkeys#destroy
```

The **Prefix** on the left clues us in to the available URL helpers.  Based on that prefix I can see that the following helpers exist: `turkeys_path`, `new_turkey_path`, `edit_turkey_path`, `turkey_path`.

From the output above I can see that some paths require **id**s.  For those helpers I'll pass an object (or an integer) to the helper when I call it.

| URL helper          | calling it with link_to |
|---------------------| -------------------------------------------|
| `turkeys_path`        | `link_to "view all turkeys", turkeys_path` |
| `new_turkey_path`     | `link_to "create a new turkey", new_turkey_path` |
| `edit_turkey_path`    | `link_to "edit this turkey", edit_turkey(@turkey)` |
| `turkey_path`         | `link_to "view this turkey", turkey_path(@turkey)` | 
| `turkey_path`         | `link_to "view this turkey", turkey_path(3021)` | 


#### Configuring URL helpers

In your router the above URL helpers are specified if you use `resources` to tell Rails that you want RESTful routes for a resource. 

```rb
# config/routes.rb
Rails.application.routes.draw do
  resources :turkeys
```

You can also set individual URL helper names via the **`as`** key.

```rb
# config/routes.rb
Rails.application.routes.draw do
  get 'posts/new', to: 'posts#new', as: 'new_post'
```

#### Summary
* You can see the available URL helpers with `rake routes`.
* You get some for free if you use `resources`.
* You can configure new URL helpers with `as` in the router.
* If a helper requires an **:id** we can pass it an integer or a model instance.


# Basic View Helpers

Rails provides a huge swath of helpers designed to make generating HTML and especially HTML related to your models more convenient.  They also reinforce the "rails-way" conventions by automatically setting html class and id attributes.  We won't cover all of them here so make sure [you do some reading](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/action_view_overview.html#overview-of-helpers-provided-by-action-view) [and maybe read the docs too](http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActionView/Helpers.html).  Don't forget about [URLHelper](http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActionView/Helpers/UrlHelper.html#method-i-link_to).



#### [`link_to`](http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActionView/Helpers/UrlHelper.html#method-i-link_to)
Generates an `a` tag (anchor link).

```rb
link_to "Profile", profile_path(@profile)
# => <a href="/profiles/1">Profile</a>
```

Setting class and id:

```ruby
link_to "Articles", articles_path, id: "news", class: "article"
# => <a href="/articles" class="article" id="news">Articles</a>
```

> Hint: run `rake routes` and look at the Prefix column to see what `_path` url helpers are available.


#### [`button_to`](http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActionView/Helpers/UrlHelper.html#method-i-button_to)
Very similar to `link_to` but may generate a form

```rb
<%= button_to "New", action: "new" %>
# => "<form method="post" action="/controller/new" class="button_to">
#      <input value="New" type="submit" />
#    </form>"
```

More useful tags:

```erb
<%= text_area_tag(:message, "Hi, nice site", size: "24x6") %>
<%= password_field_tag(:password) %>
<%= hidden_field_tag(:parent_id, "5") %>
<%= search_field(:user, :name) %>
<%= telephone_field(:user, :phone) %>
<%= date_field(:user, :born_on) %>
<%= datetime_field(:user, :meeting_time) %>
<%= datetime_local_field(:user, :graduation_day) %>
<%= month_field(:user, :birthday_month) %>
<%= week_field(:user, :birthday_week) %>
<%= url_field(:user, :homepage) %>
<%= email_field(:user, :address) %>
<%= color_field(:user, :favorite_color) %>
<%= time_field(:task, :started_at) %>
<%= number_field(:product, :price, in: 1.0..20.0, step: 0.5) %>
<%= range_field(:product, :discount, in: 1..100) %>
```

```html
<textarea id="message" name="message" cols="24" rows="6">Hi, nice site</textarea>
<input id="password" name="password" type="password" />
<input id="parent_id" name="parent_id" type="hidden" value="5" />
<input id="user_name" name="user[name]" type="search" />
<input id="user_phone" name="user[phone]" type="tel" />
<input id="user_born_on" name="user[born_on]" type="date" />
<input id="user_meeting_time" name="user[meeting_time]" type="datetime" />
<input id="user_graduation_day" name="user[graduation_day]" type="datetime-local" />
<input id="user_birthday_month" name="user[birthday_month]" type="month" />
<input id="user_birthday_week" name="user[birthday_week]" type="week" />
<input id="user_homepage" name="user[homepage]" type="url" />
<input id="user_address" name="user[address]" type="email" />
<input id="user_favorite_color" name="user[favorite_color]" type="color" value="#000000" />
<input id="task_started_at" name="task[started_at]" type="time" />
<input id="product_price" max="20.0" min="1.0" name="product[price]" step="0.5" type="number" />
<input id="product_discount" max="100" min="1" name="product[discount]" type="range" />
```

## FormBuilder - Using form tags with model instances

Many of the form tags can be tied to model instances to either set their data OR to be tied to the appropriate form POST.

It may be useful to note the difference between the [FormTagHelper](http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActionView/Helpers/FormTagHelper.html) and [FormBuilderHelper](http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActionView/Helpers/FormBuilder.html).  

* FormBuilderHelper is intended to work with model objects and does a lot to help you pre-fill values.
 * `form_for` is the main entry point for working with FormBuilderHelper.
 * Many `_tag` methods have more specialized methods for use with `form_for`
* FormTagHelper is more general

#### `form_for`
Used to build a form for an active record object.

```erb
<%= form_for @article, url: {action: "create"}, html: {class: "nifty_form"} do |f| %>
  <%= f.text_field :title %>
  <%= f.text_area :body, size: "60x12" %>
  <%= f.submit "Create" %>
<% end %>
```

```html
<form accept-charset="UTF-8" action="/articles/create" method="post" class="nifty_form">
  <input id="article_title" name="article[title]" type="text" />
  <textarea id="article_body" name="article[body]" cols="60" rows="12"></textarea>
  <input name="commit" type="submit" value="Create" />
</form>
```

Inside a form builder you'll typically operate on the form-builder object.  That is the `f` in between the `form_for .... do` and `end`.
The symbol passed to most of these methods references the model attribute (column-name) to use.  

The **name** attribute for form elements will be a combination of the model name and the symbol passed in the format `model[attribute]`.  That is:

```erb
<%= form_for @animal do |f| %>
  <%= f.text_field :species %>
```

Will give you an input tag like:
```html
<input id="article_title" name="animal[species]" type="text" />
```

And importantly, these become the keys in the params hash the controller receives when the form is submitted.  The controller will receive:

```rb
params = { 'animal' => { 'species' => 'value of the input box when submitted' } }
```

You then write controller code like:

```rb
params.require(:animal).permit(:species)
```

## More Form Methods

#### `f.text_field`

```erb
<%= form_for @article, url: {action: "create"}, html: {class: "nifty_form"} do |f| %>
  <%= f.text_field :title %>
```

#### `f.text_area`

```erb
<%= form_for @article, url: {action: "create"}, html: {class: "nifty_form"} do |f| %>
  <%= f.text_area :body, size: "60x12" %>
```

#### `f.select`

```erb
<%= form_for @person do |f| %>
  <%= f.select(:city_id) %>
<% end %>
```


#### `f.date_field` & `f.date_select` tags

```erb
<%= form_for @person do |f| %>
  <%= f.date_field :birthdate %>
<% end %>
```

```html
<form class="new_person" id="new_person" action="/people" accept-charset="UTF-8" method="post">
  <input name="utf8" type="hidden" value="✓"><input type="hidden" name="authenticity_token" value="PHkWssZGvQ==">
  <input type="date" name="person[birthdate]" id="person_birthdate">
</form>
```

OR

```erb
<%= form_for @person do |f| %>
  <%= f.date_select :birthdate %>
<% end %>
```

```html
<form class="new_person" id="new_person" action="/people" accept-charset="UTF-8" method="post"><input name="utf8" type="hidden" value="✓"><input type="hidden" name="authenticity_token" value="wfxWjMcmiPxojNAR//rCAVtJqAK7URyOya3Ub90bwAuKLdxixF7NtvuEYcDjhUU4VDDoG1qP+E8lwcRrFzbGhA==">
  <select id="person_birthdate_1i" name="person[birthdate(1i)]">
    <option value="2014">2014</option>
    <option value="2015">2015</option>
    <option value="2016" selected="selected">2016</option>
    <option value="2017">2017</option>
    <!-- trimmed -->
  </select>
  <select id="person_birthdate_2i" name="person[birthdate(2i)]">
    <option value="1" selected="selected">January</option>
    <option value="2">February</option>
    <option value="3">March</option>
    <option value="4">April</option>
    <!-- trimmed -->
  </select>
  <select id="person_birthdate_3i" name="person[birthdate(3i)]">
    <option value="1">1</option>
    <option value="2">2</option>
    <option value="3">3</option>
    <!-- trimmed -->
    <option value="30">30</option>
    <option value="31">31</option>
  </select>
</form>
```

#### `hidden_field` or `f.hidden_field`
Creates an `input` tag with attribute `type='hidden'`.
```rb
hidden_field(:signup, :pass_confirm)
```

## PUT, PATCH, DELETE

Most browsers don't support PUT, PATCH & DELETE as form submission methods.  Rails however has a _work-around_ for this.  

Rails adds a hidden form field and processes this on a POST request, internally changing the request type.  

```erb
form_tag(search_path, method: "patch")
```

```html
<form accept-charset="UTF-8" action="/search" method="post">
  <input name="_method" type="hidden" value="patch" />
  <input name="utf8" type="hidden" value="&#x2713;" />
  <input name="authenticity_token" type="hidden" value="f755bb0ed134b76c432144748a6d4b7a7ddf2b71" />
  ...
</form>
```
